‘But why should we have all the negative aspects without any of the benefits? It’s a lose-lose for us,’ my friend argued regarding why our male friend should sleep on the floor while us girls sleep on the comfy couch during out little reunion in Paris. I might have let this remark slip by, but I recently encountered some studies on benevolent sexism. So I wanted to explain to my self-proclaimed feminist friend why women expecting benefits based on their gender is harmful.

Refusing to split the bill, letting a women skip him in a queue, expressing views such as women have better taste and are more intuitive… Doesn’t sound like sexism? That’s because these are examples of benevolent sexism, a far more insidious kind of sexism.

What is benevolent sexism?
There are actually two different types of sexism: hostile sexism and benevolent sexism. We’re all familiar with hostile sexism; the explicitly negative view that women are inferior to men and attempt to manipulate and control men with their sexuality and feminist ideology (Glick and Fiske 2001).
Hostile sexism is easy to recognise, while benevolent sexism is far more ambiguous. Benevolent sexism is the belief that women should be cherished and protected by men. Positive views such as women are more nurturing and morally astute than men, are intertwined with negative views, such as women are emotionally frail and dependent on men. So although it sounds flattering or chivalrous, benevolent sexism is a patronising ideology that justifies women’s inferior position to men (Jackman, 1994).

However, this flattery and preferential treatment is only offered to women who fit the traditional female stereotype of nurturing and incompetent, while non-conforming hard-nosed business women and feminists are perceived as cold and manipulative (Becker, 2010; Glick, Diebold, Bailey-Werner, & Zhu, 1997).

Glick and Fiske authored a seminal paper in 1996 which outlined three aspects of benevolent sexism: protective paternalism, heterosexual intimacy and complementary gender differentiation.
Protective paternalism is when women are seen as child-like and incompetent which legitimises the need for men to protect and care for women as a superordinate paternal figure. For example, if a guy forbids his girlfriend from entering a dodgy part of town. Heterosexual intimacy describes how men may rely on women for their romantic and sexual needs. An example of a protective paternalism and heterosexual intimacy dynamic is the emergence of Sugar Daddy/Sugar Baby sites wherein rich men (i.e., ‘sugar daddies’) can find attractive women (i.e., ‘sugar babies’) for whom they provide for financially while there is the expectation that the ‘sugar babies’ satisfy their romantic/sexual needs.

Complementary gender differentiation is the belief that women embody a certain set of stereotypical characteristics best suited for home-making while men possess the necessary traits for politics and business. And so by portraying women as nurturing and morally sensible but incompetent and in need of protection like a typical damsel in distress. Again, this mentality justifies women having lower-status positions (Jost & Kay, 2005).

To be clear, the idea that women are better than men regarding some traits is equally as sexist as the idea that they are inferior to men. Gender equality means that women and men should be given the same opportunities and treatment, with no one gaining privilege over the other based on their sex.

How does benevolent sexism affect women in the workplace?
Benevolent sexism can undermine women’s professional persona and position women in a more traditional and stereotypical gender role. Research conducted in 2011 by Barreto and colleagues found that female Dutch students who expected to collaborate with a male partner who demonstrated benevolent sexist views (e.g. women need men’s help and women have better taste) defined themselves less in task-related self-descriptions (i.e., how important competence and achievement is to them) compared with those who exposed to hostile sexist views. This means that if a male co-worker expresses benevolent sexist views, it undermines women’s achievement-related self-esteem (e.g., ‘my self-esteem is influenced by how well I perform in competitive tasks’) and shifts their focus to more relational qualities, such as being attentive, warm, and romantic. This is consequential because, as Barreto et al. comment, “task-related self-descriptions can be important precursors of professional success”.

Moreover, female participants were more likely to pass up the opportunity to be leader of their pair when they expected to be partnered with a benevolent sexist man, compared with those who expected to interact with a non-sexist man or no partner. This is possibly because when the idea that women are good at stereotypically female activities is salient, taking on a leadership role (a stereotypical masculine role) becomes all the more daunting. This shows how insidious benevolent sexism is because perpetrators appear to have positive views of women, yet these views undermine women’s confidence in challenging stereotypical gender roles by demonstrating their leadership qualities. Given the importance placed on tough-minded pragmatism and confident leadership skills in professional domains, benevolent sexist beliefs may be the reason that women fail to make it to the upper echelons in corporate and political arenas, i.e., the glass ceiling effect. Benevolent sexism is particularly insidious because it is not seen as prejudice and women may find it sweet and difficult to challenge.

But the problem is that it’s not just men; some women endorse benevolent sexism too. This is problematic, not just for the workplace, but because benevolent sexism and hostile sexism are two heads of the same coin. Men who endorse benevolent sexism are more likely to legitimise domestic violence domestic violence (Sakalli, 2002), sexual harassment (Pryor et al., 1995) and view rape victims negatively (Viki and Abrams, 2002).

Why do women endorse benevolent sexism?
Women could endorse benevolent sexism for a range of reasons. Researchers, Becker and Wright (2011), suggest that because complementary gender differentiation implies that women have attributes that men do not have women may feel more comfortable in a intersex workplace situation where they would otherwise have felt insecure in a male-dominated work environment.

There are also rewards of benevolent sexism on an individual basis. Chivalrous men will sacrifice their own wellbeing to take care of their woman, for example providing for her financially so she doesn’t have to work and putting her needs ahead of his own (Glick and Fiske, 2001).

Wanting it both ways?
Women protest the cultural and institutional discrimination they face, yet do not object to the privileges they enjoy due to their gender, “including exemption from military conscription and combat duty, and inequalities in child custody and divorce settlement rulings” according to Kilianski and Rudman (1998).

This is an example of the ‘wanting it both ways’ mentality. Kilianski and Rudman (1998) proposed that women endorse benevolent sexism because they do not realise that benevolent sexism goes hand in hand with hostile sexism.

They investigated this topic by asking US female participants to read the profile of a hostile, benevolent and non-sexist male and rate how favourably they viewed the three men. They found that women who do not realise there is a link between hostile and benevolent sexism are significantly more likely to view a benevolent sexist male favourably while simultaneously disapproving of hostile sexism. This shows that women who do not see the link between benevolent and hostile sexism, favour those who exhibit benevolent sexism while denouncing hostile sexism.

Kilianski and Rudman comment that “by responding in positive ways to benevolent sexism, women may unwittingly buttress related hostile sexist beliefs in men. The differences between beliefs that support protective paternalism and those that underlie dominative paternalism may be quite subtle; in fact, Glick and Fiske (1996) argue that the overlap is considerable. According to Sigel (1996), by enacting the role of provider and protector to women, men may come to feel entitled to dominance.”
Women’s beliefs about the importance of the environment in determining behaviour also impacted on whether they showed this ‘wanting it both ways’ mentality. Those who acknowledge the influence of the social environment and social convention on people’s behaviour were considerably less likely to endorse benevolent sexism compared with those who believe that behaviour is determined by biology. Whether the participants had professional or more domestic/maternal life goals did not impact upon their endorsement of benevolent sexism beliefs.

Justifying a discriminatory system?
Jost and Kay (2005) suggest some women may believe the ‘advantages’ of benevolent sexism balance out the ‘disadvantages’ of hostile sexism which results in the impression that the gender system is just. That is, benevolent sexist beliefs appear to compensate for economic inequality and justifies the discriminatory status quo system. It may be psychologically tough to accept that one is a victim of discrimination and so many women may accept benevolent sexism because it is easier to believe that things are just and fair. This idea is backed by the correlation between national endorsement of benevolent sexism and UN indicators of gender inequality (e.g., greater lack of participation of women in economy and politics). In the most unequal societies, women endorsed benevolent sexism more than men. This also creates a more favourable social identity for women (Glick and Fiske, 2001).

Hindering the equality agenda
Becker and Wright (2011) found that (mostly German) female participants who read sentences that illustrated benevolent sexism felt the gender system was just (women are not discriminated against and everything is as it should be), saw the advantages of being a women and felt more positive. This decreased participants’ willingness to sign a gender-related petition and distribute flyers raising awareness of gender inequality. On the other hand, hostile sexism decreased the perception of the gender system as just along with the advantages of being a woman and their mood, which meant they were more likely to take action against gender inequality. This shows how benevolent sexism is a significant barrier to uniting women in the fight against sexism.

How to spot benevolent sexism?
Benevolent sexism, like any other form of prejudice, must be perceived as such before it can be challenged. Barreto and Ellemer (2005) argue that benevolent sexism leads to the maintenance of gender inequality precisely because it goes unnoticed. Their research shows a person who exhibits benevolent sexist beliefs is not seen as sexist because their opinions are positive and this deviates from the traditional idea of what a sexist is.

According to Kilianski and Rudman (1998) it is the underlying behaviour that determines whether the behaviour is benevolent sexist or not. For example, if a man supports a company’s efforts to recruit and develop the skills of more female employees because socio-cultural norms, restricting gender roles have led to structural inequalities which must be overcome with compensatory strategies. Well, that’s actually quite feminist. However, if a man supports the same policy because he believes women will never be able to reach higher echelons on a ‘level playing field’, or he likes the idea of a few more ‘skirts’ around the office; then that is definitely sexist.

So holding the door open may not be benevolent sexism in itself; it depends on whether that person is holding the door open just to be nice or whether they are holding the door open to be nice to a woman. A good rule of thumb is to consider whether that person would treat a man in the exact same way.

What to do?
Benevolent sexism can be difficult to navigate, but knowing what you now know about protective paternalism, complimentary gender differentiation and heterosexual intimacy listen out for clues from social interaction. And remember it’s not just men that endorse benevolent sexism so pull your gal pals up on it too.

Glick and Fiske (2001) urge women to take responsibility for the role they play in benevolent sexism and indirectly maintaining gender inequality, yet they warn against blaming the victim. This is not meant as an attack on women, but to educate on what many may not realise to be a significant hurdle in the struggle for gender equality. Not expecting preferential treatment and rejecting it when it is offered may be less convenient at the time, but endorsing benevolent sexism is far more detrimental in the long term, for you, your relationship, and your career. As Virginia Wolfe commented gender equality will occur when ‘womanhood has ceased to be a protected occupation’, (p 40).
